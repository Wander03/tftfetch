\title{Fetch Riot Account Data by PUUID}
\usage{
get_account_by_puuid(puuid, routing_region, api_key)
}
\arguments{
\item{puuid}{A character string representing the player's PUUID (Player Universally Unique ID).}

\item{routing_region}{A character string representing the player's region (americas, asia, europe)}

\item{api_key}{A character string containing your valid Riot API key.}
}
\value{
A list containing the player's PUUID, gameName, and tagLine.
}
\description{
Retrieves a player's Riot Account information (PUUID, gameName, and tagLine)
using the Riot Account-V1 endpoint, specifically by providing their PUUID.
}
\details{
This function interacts with the \verb{https://\{routing_region\}.api.riotgames.com/riot/account/v1/accounts/by-puuid/\{puuid\}}
endpoint.

The \code{puuid} (Player Universally Unique ID) is a unique identifier for a player
across all Riot Games titles and regions. It can be obtained from other APIs
like \code{get_account_by_riot_id()} or from match data.

The \code{routing_region} parameter (e.g., "americas", "asia", "europe") determines
which API cluster the request is sent to. For Account-V1 endpoints, the account
data is globally accessible. This means you can query any PUUID through any
of these regional routing values, and you will receive the same result.
It is recommended to use the regional routing value closest to your service's
physical location to minimize latency.

\dontrun{
# Replace with your actual API key and a valid PUUID
api_key <- "YOUR_API_KEY"
example_puuid <- "YOUR_EXAMPLE_PUUID_HERE"
account_info_by_puuid <- get_account_by_riot_id(puuid = example_puuid, routing_region = "americas", api_key = api_key)
print(account_info_by_puuid$gameName)
}
