\title{Fetch Riot Account Data by Riot Game Name and Tag Line}
\usage{
get_account_by_riot_id(game_name, tag_line, routing_region, api_key)
}
\arguments{
\item{game_name}{A character string representing the player's game name (the part of the Riot ID \emph{before} the '#').}

\item{tag_line}{A character string representing the player's tag line (the part of the Riot ID \emph{after} the '#').}

\item{routing_region}{A character string representing the API routing region (e.g., "americas", "asia", "europe").}

\item{api_key}{A character string containing your valid Riot API key.

The \code{routing_region} parameter (e.g., "americas", "asia", "europe") determines
which API cluster the request is sent to. For Account-V1 endpoints, the account
data is globally accessible, meaning you can query any Riot ID through any
of these regional routing values, and you will receive the same result.
It is recommended to use the regional routing value closest to your service's
physical location to minimize latency.}
}
\value{
A list containing the player's PUUID, gameName, and tagLine.
}
\description{
Retrieves a player's Riot Account information (PUUID, gameName, and tagLine)
using the Riot Account-V1 endpoint.
}
\details{
This function interacts with the \verb{https://\{routing_region\}.api.riotgames.com/riot/account/v1/accounts/by-riot-id/\{game_name\}/\{tag_line\}}
endpoint.

Riot IDs are formatted as "GameName#TagLine" (e.g., "Wander#HENRO").
This function requires the two parts (\code{game_name} and \code{tag_line}) to be
provided as separate arguments.

\dontrun{
# Replace with actual credentials
api_key <- "YOUR_API_KEY"
account_info <- get_account_by_riot_id(game_name = "Wander", tag_line = "HENRO", routing_region = "americas", api_key)
print(account_info$puuid)
}
